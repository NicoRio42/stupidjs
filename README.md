# Stupid JS

You can't claim to be a frontend developer if you don't have your own JS framework : here is mine ;)

Joking aside, this is more like an experiment to learn more about web APIs and reactivity. The result is actually pretty cool!

The code is heavyly inspired from Solid JS for the core mechanisms, and a bit from svelte for some part of the API.

There is no compiler (yet ?), so there are extra costs at the components creation (when parsing the template and initializing the reactivity) and for the scoped styles mechanisms.
